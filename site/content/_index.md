        **The Impossibility of Ethical Calculation: Centralised AI Governance and the Suppression of Moral Discovery**
        
        The paper analyzes the ethical governance of AI through the Mises–Hayek critique of centralized planning, introducing the notion of an “impossibility of ethical calculation.” It argues that the AI Act and the GDPR impose a preventive, compliance-based model that blocks the decentralized discovery of ethical preferences and limits the adaptive capacity of information flows. The conclusion is that such centralization reduces moral autonomy and fosters regulatory capture.
